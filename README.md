### Inspiration
- A practice of using Django to build a back-end web framework.
- Designed to create a user-friendly chatting website focusing on grouped experience. Further developments can include but are not limited to wallet authentication, social media authentication, in-room betting, live news-driven price action watching, live block buying and selling, etc

### Reference
- This project would not have come to realization without the guidance from [TraversyMedia](https://www.traversymedia.com/) as well as his wonderful [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@TraversyMedia)
